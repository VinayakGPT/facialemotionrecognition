# facialemotionrecognition
This project implements a deep learning model for classifying emotions from images into seven categories: surprise, fear, angry, neutral, sad, disgust, and happy. The solution involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize emotions and deploying the model using a Streamlit web application for real-time interaction.
